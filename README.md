RetroAdventure
==============

My first attempt at building game physics, and also drawing sprites and various pixel drawings

Whats in the game:
This game is basing off of a Mario style platformer. There will be obstacles and enemies (pretty standard stuff) and each level will fade into the next.

What I am working on:
I am currently writing code for this game in the Processing programming language and drawing sprites (with full motions) as well as various backgrounds and obstacles.

Purpose of this project:
Basically to get my feet wet dealing with game physics and drawing useful pixel drawings
